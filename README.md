Project description
=======

This is a mini project build with python 3 with tkinter GUI lib.

It's a 100% simulation of Multi-line video poker machine like things can be found in most of casino. There are 3 lines in gameboard, and each line drew 5 cards at you first drew. At first drew cards will be same in 3 lines but it is actually from 3 different deck. After your first drew, you can change any card by click to flip that card at line#1, since cards from each line come from different deck, so the reasults for 2nd drew at every lines are uncorrelated. Once your second drew is done, problem will check your hands on each line and display the result on screen.

To setup this project just clone or download zip, and ensure install tkinter lib in your python3 environment then run MultiPoker.py :)
